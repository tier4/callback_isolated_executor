# Comparison of Real-Time Performance with Other ROS 2 Executors

This document compares the real-time performance of the ROS 2 Default Executor and Executors proposed in academic literature from the following perspectives:

**Immediate Enqueue of Ready Callbacks**

In the ROS 2 Default Executor, a callback instance that becomes ready is enqueued only when the queue becomes empty. If the callback is enqueued immediately at the moment it becomes ready, ✔ is marked.

**Per-Callback Priority Assignment**

The ROS 2 Default Executor does not provide an API to assign priorities on a per-callback basis. If an Executor provides such an API, or allows users to assign priorities per callback through another mechanism, ✔ is marked.

**Non-Nested Scheduling**

In many Executors, the Executor maintains its own scheduling layer (e.g., a ready queue with priority ordering), and the OS independently schedules the threads that run callbacks. This two-level structure is referred to as nested scheduling.
If the Executor's scheduling and the OS scheduling do not form such a nested structure, ✔ is marked.

**Fully Preemptive**

If a lower-priority callback can be preempted by any higher-priority callback during execution, ✔ is marked.

**Support for Reentrant Callbacks**

If, when a callback becomes ready while it is executing, it can be properly enqueued and executed, ✔ is marked.

**ROS 2 Mainline**

If the Executor has been merged into the ROS 2 mainline, or can be introduced without modifying the ROS 2 implementation, ✔ is marked.
